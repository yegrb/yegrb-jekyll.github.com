Our next meetup is coming up fast and is only a few days away.  <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/yegrb.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dHhCUmZxSzlmbFJCeGZ0MWtLcXNib2c6MA#gid=0">RSVP now if you haven't already</a>!  You can also <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=c9f4">submit questions for Aman online</a>.

Following up on our last post we would like to announce that we're moving venues for this special meetup and will meeting at Axis Cafe on Jasper Avenue, rather than our normal location.  Yardstick Software has kindly sponsored us, and will be providing picking up the tab for the first few attendees.  There will be a $6 drink special after that!
