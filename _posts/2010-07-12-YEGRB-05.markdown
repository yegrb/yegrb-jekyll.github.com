title: YEGRB 0.5 - Tuesday July 20th at Axis Cafe on Jasper\
category: meetups\
----\
The next YEGRB meetup is only a week away, and I'm excited to announce
more details. But first if you haven't already, please
<a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/yegrb.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dEhFNk1ybGdmMGVXOFdRemFYdW0wdUE6MA#gid=0 ">RSVP</a>.

The topics this month include:

<ul>
<li>
An introduction to AMQP/RabbitMQ, by Scott Brooks

</li>
<li>
Deployment Part 2: EngineYard, by Daniel Huckstep

</li>
<li>
CanCan('t), by Mark Bennett

</li>
<li>
Deploying your rails app with Moonshine, by Luke Hutscal

</li>
</ul>
Scott will be going in-depth during his talk and will be running a
little longer than normal, but we still hope to get things wrapped in
under an hour so there's lots of time for drinks afterwards.

This meetup has also been kindly sponsored by
<a href="http://www.yardsticksoftware.com/ ">Yardstick Software</a>. As
with last meetup, they'll be providing a tab on a first come first serve
basis. Like last time the meetup will be at <a href="/meetup">Axis Cafe
on Jasper Ave</a>. Doors open at 18:15 and the meetup will start at
18:30.

<p>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Added Luke to the speaker list. He'll be
talking about Deploying your Rails app with Moonshine.
