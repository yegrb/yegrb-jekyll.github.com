hard to believe we're already on to our fourth YEGRB meetup, and this is
going to be the best one yet! Aman Gupta
(<a href="http://github.com/tmm1">github</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/tmm1">twitter</a>) will be joining us via
the web to present "Debugging Ruby: understanding and troubleshooting
the VM and your application". Aman is a serial entrepreneur, ruby hacker
and a recent winner of a Ruby Heroes award. He currently maintains the
EventMachine project and various other gems that help build
high-performance distributed and asynchronous systems in ruby, including
em-mysql, em-spec, jsSocket and amqp.

Most recently, Aman has been hacking on performance improvements to MRI,
and tools for the VM such as perftools.rb, a sampling profiler for ruby
code based on google-perftools, and gdb.rb, a MRI specific version of
gdb.

We've setup a
<a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=c9f4">Google Moderator
channel to collect questions for Aman</a> in advance of his talk. Submit
your questions early and vote on the ones you're most interested in so
that we make maximum use of his time. You can also record a YouTube
video of yourself asking your question.

The meetup will be taking place on June 15th @ 18:30 MST. Please
<a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/yegrb.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dHhCUmZxSzlmbFJCeGZ0MWtLcXNib2c6MA#gid=0">RSVP
in advance</a>. We're making some special arrangements for this months
venue and will announce the location details later on this week.
