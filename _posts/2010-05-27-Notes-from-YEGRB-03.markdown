Thanks to everyone who came out to our meetup last week. It wasn't our
biggest meetup, but it was a good one!

On the housekeeping side we did a quick wrap-up of the first hackup. It
went well, and though lots of new projects were started it will be a few
weeks before we've got anything to show for. Keep your eye on the
<a href="http://github.com/yegrb">YEGRB Github account</a> where some of
the hackup projects call home! Planning for the next hackup has started
and we should be ready to make an announcement in the next few weeks.

We've also moved our meetup to the third Tuesday of every month, where
it should be staying. Mark the third Tuesday of your calendar or
subscribe to our
