YEGRB is excited to host Edmonton's first Ruby Hackup on May 8th from
10am-5pm.

The hackup, unlike our meetups, is a communal coding event where members
have one minute to pitch their idea and describe their interests to the
rest of the group. After that we break and people can collaborate as
they like. We provide a venue, along with internet and power. We're
hoping this will become a regular event.

Space for our first hackup is limited to fifteen people. The
registration will go up later this week on a first-come first-serve
basis. Watch <a href="http://twitter.com/yegrb">our twitter account</a>
for the announcement!
