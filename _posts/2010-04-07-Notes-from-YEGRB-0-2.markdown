----

Thanks again to everyone that came out to YEGRB 0.2. We had an even
bigger turnout than last time with lots of new faces, as well as people
coming back from the last meeting.

We heard the feedback from last time and kept things moving along at
quick pace. Thanks to our great speakers we were able to achieve this
goal and wrapped on schedule with time left to go to Pub 1905 for a few
drinks.

The talks themselves where great and started off with Chris Brulak
(<a href="http://twitter.com/cbrulak">cbrulak</a>) presenting on
<a href="http://elxn41.ca/home/login_to_beta">Elxn41.ca</a>. Chris'
application provides a platform for participants to debate and follow
the political issues of the day. This discussion is meant to be
interactive, and emphasise a dialog between members. Chris contrasted
the conversation that happens on Elxn41.ca with a service such as
Twitter where participants shout into a crowded space. In developing
Elxn41.ca Chris used a number of popular gems including
<a href="http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">authlogic</a> and
<a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_versioned">acts\_as\_versioned</a>.
He tried the Twitter authentication component in authlogic but decided
to use the <a href="http://github.com/mbleigh/twitter-auth">twitter-auth
gem</a> for authentication in it's place. If you'd like to try this
application just visit <a href="http://elxn41.ca">http://elxn41.ca</a>
and login with the beta password 'democracyrocks'. Chris is actively
looking for developers to help build out the Elxn41.ca feature set. If
you'd like to help out contact him at
<a href="mailto:elxn41@elxn41.ca">elxn41\@elxn41.ca</a>.

The next speaker was Sean Ouimet
(<a href="http://twitter.com/skepticsean">\@skepticsean</a>) presenting
on <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> and
<a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a>. Sean walked everyone
through the basics of Sinatra, including how to create a web application
and declared your routes and the code which handles them. He then moved
into some more advanced Sinatra scenarios. In particular his
demonstrtation of how to embed multiple Sinatra apps in a single Rack
application was intriqing as it can be used to deploy Rails and Sinatra
in the same application. We've included Sean's slides below if you'd
like to see his code again.

Our last lightning talk was by Mark Bennett
(<a href="http://twitter.com/markbennett">\@MarkBennett</a>). He
presented a new gem he'd written called
<a href="http://wiki.github.com/MarkBennett/adman/">Adman</a> which
makes it easy to share your Sinatra or Rails application using Bonjour
(aka Zeroconf). With Adman anyone can find and resolve your applications
IP automatically without using a DNS server or publishing your IP in
advance. This is especially useful at hackups, conferences, or
RailsCamps where access to the Internet is limited. If you'd like to try
Adman for yourself just run, "gem install adman". Check out
<a href="http://github.com/MarkBennett/adman">Adman on GitHub</a> and
<a href="http://wiki.github.com/MarkBennett/adman/">read the wiki</a>
for more details. Adman is under active development, and Mark want's to
make using Bonjour in your app a one liner.

With the lighting talks wrapped up on time some of the attendees with
iPad's kindly demonstrated them for the rest of the group. Reg Cheramy
(<a href="http://twitter.com/rcheramy">\@rcheramy</a>) from
<a href="http://www.edistorm.com/">Edistorm</a> demonstrated some of his
favourite features and apps already running on the iPad as well as some
development work he's done with the iPad. He wasn't the only one with an
iPad as Cam Linke and another attendee also brought their iPads out.
Thanks guys, the iPad looks like it's going to be another winner for
Apple. Can't wait to order mine at the end of the month.

Thanks again to all the attendees who made it out to this months meetup.
Our primary mission is to connect local Ruby enthusiasts, so seeing how
well attended the meetups have been is really encouraging. I know there
are still lots of you out there who haven't made it out to an event yet,
but we're looking forward to seeing you at YEGRB 0.3. Also watch for us
to explore new ways of connecting the Ruby community in the coming
months.
