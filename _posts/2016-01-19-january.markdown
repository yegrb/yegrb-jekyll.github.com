* This month:

[YEGRB Beginner's Track Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YetQ2AeFPhSwCB-OHGwIZrx9O-aKJo6SR2dqwie72n4/edit)

In the YEGRB Beginner’s Track this year, we’ll be working through the exercises on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io) together. Exercism.io gives you problems to solve using the Ruby programming language (and other languages too!) and the problems come in the form of tests that you can run to see if your program is working or not. This is a great tool because testing your code will give you fast feedback and speed up your learning process.

## January 19th Exercises:
hamming, gigasecond, rna-transcription

Please make an effort to work on problems before coming to the beginner’s track. It will help you learn the material much better. However, if you are unable to work on the problems, please feel welcome to attend anyhow.
