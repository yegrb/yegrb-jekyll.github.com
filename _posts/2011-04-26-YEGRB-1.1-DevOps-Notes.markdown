Iterative Chef by [\@fnichol](http://twitter.com/fnichol)
---------------------------------------------------------

Fletcher Nichol gave an in-depth talk on bootstrapping a solo box with
Chef. He started by using standard shell scripts to configure his box,
and slowly iterated his examples to leverage more Chef best practices.
He's kindly posted [his complete
notes](http://fnichol.github.com/iterative_chef/) on GitHub.

Puppet by [\@darkhelmetlive](http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Daniel Huckstep finished the night with a discussion of using Puppet for
automated server management. The repo he used for deployment is private
so despite the fact that he used it as an example, he can't open it up.
If you're interested in learning more about Puppet he suggests visiting
[Puppet Labs](http://www.puppetlabs.com/) and
[FabFile](http://fabfile.org/). The puppet docs are also pretty solid.
