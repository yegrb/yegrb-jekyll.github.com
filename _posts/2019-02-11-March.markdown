## Who We Are

YEGRB is Edmontonâ€™s local Ruby Meetup. Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. This meetup is held monthly for people of all abilities and backgrounds who share one thing: an interest in the language that was designed for humans first.
